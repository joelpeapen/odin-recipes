        <li>¼ cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped flat-leaf (Italian) parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the
                bite, about 11
                minutes, adding frozen peas during the last 2 minutes of cooking time. Drain pasta and peas, reserving 1
                cup cooking
                liquid.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While the pasta is cooking, heat butter and olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
                mushrooms and onion;
                cook until mushrooms are brown, 5 to 7 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Cook in the same skillet over medium-high heat until browned and no
                longer pink, 7
                to 10 minutes. Add the mushrooms back to the skillet. Add cream cheese, lemon juice, and lemon zest;
                stir until cream
                cheese is melted. Remove from heat.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Fold in Parmesan and Pecorino Romano cheeses, then parsley. Toss with pasta and peas, adding reserved
                cooking liquid as
                necessary to make a sauce.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
