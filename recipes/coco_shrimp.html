    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These coconut shrimp are rolled in a coconut beer batter before frying. I use orange marmalade, mustard, and
        horseradish mixed to taste for a dipping sauce.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>⅔ cup beer</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>2 cups flaked coconut</li>
        <li>24 shrimp</li>
        <li>3 cups oil for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Line a baking sheet with wax paper; set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Whisk together 1/2 cup flour, beer, egg, and baking powder in a medium bowl until smooth. Place coconut
                and remaining 1/4 cup flour in 2 separate bowls.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>One at a time, hold shrimp by the tail and dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Dip in beer batter; allow
                excess to drip off. Roll in coconut, then place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate for 30
                minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Working in batches, fry shrimp in hot oil, turning once, until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Use tongs to
                remove shrimp to paper towels to drain. Serve warm with your favorite dipping sauce.</p>
        </li>
